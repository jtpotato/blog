### Step 1: Flash EV3DEV onto microSD Card

1. Follow the instructions provided by EV3DEV to flash a microSD SDHC card with the EV3DEV operating system.
2. Insert the flashed microSD card into your EV3 brick and boot it up.
3. Connect to the EV3 brick via SSH. By default, the hostname is `ev3dev.local`. Use the following command to establish the SSH connection:

   ```
   ssh robot@ev3dev.local
   ```

### Step 2: Generate SSH Keys

1. If you haven't already, generate SSH keys on your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   ssh-keygen
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.

### Step 3: Copy SSH Keys to EV3 Brick

1. Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to copy your local SSH public key to the EV3 brick. Replace `remote-user` and `remote-host` with your appropriate username and hostname:

   ```
   ssh-copy-id remote-user@remote-host
   ```

   For EV3DEV, the default username and hostname are `robot` and `ev3dev.local`, respectively.

### Step 4: Create a Rust Program

1. Install Rust programming language and Cargo if you haven't already. Follow the official Rust documentation for installation instructions: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Create a new Rust project using Cargo and the `ev3dev_lang_rust` package. This package provides bindings to the EV3DEV API for Rust. Run the following command to create a new project:

   ```
   cargo new --bin my_ev3_project
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up Cross-Compilation

1. Install the `armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi` toolchain for Rust using rustup:

   ```
   rustup target add armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi
   ```

2. Configure Cargo to use the specified toolchain for cross-compilation by creating a `.cargo/config` file in your project directory with the following contents:

   ```toml
   [build]
   target = "armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi"
   ```

### Step 6: Compile and Deploy

1. Write your Rust program in the `src` directory of your project.
2. Use Cargo to build your program with the specified toolchain:

   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. After successful compilation, your compiled binary will be located at `target/armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi/release/{application_name}`.

4. Create a Makefile in your project directory to automate the deployment process. Include commands to copy the compiled binary to your EV3 brick using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol). Here's an example Makefile:

   ```makefile
   SRC := target/armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi/release/my_ev3_project
   BRICK_NAME := robot@ev3dev.local

   deploy:
       scp $(SRC) $(BRICK_NAME):/home/robot/my_ev3_project
   ```

   Run `make deploy` to automatically copy the compiled binary to your EV3 brick.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your environment for Rust programming on EV3DEV and deployed your first Rust program to your EV3 brick. Happy coding!
