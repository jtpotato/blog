title: Using Rust on an EV3

The Lego Mindstorms EV3 might be the very origin story of my journey in STEM. It was my first exposure to programming and robotics competitions, and for this, it still holds a special place in my heart.

Many years have passed since then, and EV3-G has been replaced by a Scratch-like programming language. However, having been able to figuratively "see the world" of traditional programming languages (and why the world isn't run on low-code/no-code) and finally given a chance to return to the EV3 for Robocup soccer, I decided to investigate how to use a more modern language - Rust - on the EV3.

### Step 1: Flash EV3DEV onto microSD Card

1. Follow the instructions provided by EV3DEV to flash a microSD SDHC card with the [EV3DEV operating system](https://www.ev3dev.org/).
2. Insert the flashed microSD card into your EV3 brick and boot it up.
3. Connect to the EV3 brick via SSH. By default, the hostname is `ev3dev.local`. Use the following command to establish the SSH connection:

   ```
   ssh robot@ev3dev.local
   ```

### Step 2: Generate SSH Keys

1. If you haven't already, generate SSH keys on your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   ssh-keygen
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.

### Step 3: Copy SSH Keys to EV3 Brick

1. Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to copy your local SSH public key to the EV3 brick. Replace `remote-user` and `remote-host` with your appropriate username and hostname:

   ```
   ssh-copy-id robot@ev3dev.local
   ```

   For EV3DEV, the default username and hostname are `robot` and `ev3dev.local`.

### Step 4: Create a Rust Program

1. Install Rust programming language and Cargo if you haven't already. Follow the official Rust documentation for installation instructions: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Create a new Rust project using Cargo and the `ev3dev_lang_rust` [package](https://github.com/pixix4/ev3dev-lang-rust). This package provides bindings to the EV3DEV API for Rust. Run the following command to create a new project:

   ```
   cargo new my_ev3_project
   cd my_ev3_project
   cargo add ev3dev_lang_rust
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up Cross-Compilation

1. Install the `armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi` toolchain for Rust using rustup:

   ```
   rustup target add armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi
   ```

2. Configure Cargo to use the specified toolchain for cross-compilation by creating a `.cargo/config.toml` file in your project directory with the following contents:

   ```toml
   [build]
   target = "armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi"
   ```

### Step 6: Compile and Deploy

1. Write your Rust program in the `src` directory of your project.
2. Use Cargo to build your program with the specified toolchain:

   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. After successful compilation, your compiled binary will be located at `target/armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi/release/{application_name}`.

4. Create a Makefile in your project directory to automate the deployment process. Include commands to copy the compiled binary to your EV3 brick using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol). Here's an example Makefile:

   ```makefile
   SRC := target/armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi/release/my_ev3_project
   BRICK_NAME := robot@ev3dev.local

   deploy:
       scp $(SRC) $(BRICK_NAME):/home/robot/my_ev3_project
   ```

   Run `make deploy` to automatically copy the compiled binary to your EV3 brick.
